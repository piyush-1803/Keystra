## 2024-03-20 - Memoizing derived data in high-frequency React components
**Learning:** In Electron applications where React components receive real-time stats updating multiple times per second (like `liveStats`), expensive array filtering, sorting, and map iterations for chart data directly in the render function will block the main thread.
**Action:** Always wrap heavy derived state computations (like SVG wave paths or aggregate statistics) in `useMemo` specifically targeting the slower-moving dependency (like `stats` history) to isolate them from high-frequency state updates.
